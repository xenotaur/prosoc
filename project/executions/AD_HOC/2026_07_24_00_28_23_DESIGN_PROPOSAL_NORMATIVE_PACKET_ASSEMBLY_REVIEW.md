# Summary

Addressed two Copilot review comments on PR #36
(PROP-NORMATIVE-PACKET-ASSEMBLY), both factual/consistency nits on the
proposal's Prior Art Check section. No primary execution record exists for
this PR yet — the proposal was authored via `/lrh-proposal`, not
`/lrh-implement`, so `rerun_of` is left empty; the primary record will be
created when PR #36 is closed out.

# Result

**Comment 1 (duplication-search claim)** — the reviewer noted the claim that
`grep -rl` for `packet`/`manifest`/`provenance` "returns nothing" was
incorrect for `provenance`. Verified: `provenance` appears in six in-repo
files (e.g. `prosoc/scenarios/workflow.md`,
`.claude/skills/prosoc-scenario-audit/SKILL.md`), while `packet` and
`manifest` genuinely return nothing. Narrowed the claim to `packet`/`manifest`
and clarified that `provenance` appears only as a concept in existing
card/audit docs, with no assembler or provenance-envelope implementation.

**Comment 2 (demand-search bullet)** — the reviewer noted "Proposals: None
found" reads as contradicting repo state once this proposal exists. Rephrased
to "None found requesting this capability — this set is the repo's first
design proposal," which states the intended meaning without the post-merge
contradiction.

Both comments passed presence/validity/feasibility triage; neither conflicted
with an intentional design decision. No comments were skipped.

# Validation

- `scripts/format --check`: 16 pre-existing Python files flagged, **none
  touched by this change** (the diff is a single Markdown file; black does not
  process Markdown). Confirmed the same 16 files fail with this change stashed,
  so the drift is pre-existing on the branch and independent of this PR — not
  repaired here, as reformatting unrelated Python files is out of scope for a
  documentation review-response.
- `scripts/lint`: All checks passed.
- `scripts/test`: 80 passed.
- `lrh validate`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.

# Follow-up

- `session_transcript` is `pending`; update to `claude-app:<session-id>` after
  the session ends.
- PR #36 base still points at the merged scaffold branch and needs retargeting
  to `main` before it can merge.
- Suggest `/lrh-confirm-fixes` on PR #36 before merge to resolve the two
  review threads.
